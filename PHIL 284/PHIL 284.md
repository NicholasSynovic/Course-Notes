### The Justification of Intentionally Arranged Deaths
* Under which conditions, if any, is it permissible for a patient and a HCP to arrange for assistance in intentionally ending the patient's life?
	* For some patients where not even medical tech will assist in their inevitable demise or save them from the pain, they may want to die
	* Some argue that if a HCP takes an active part in the death it is considered killing instead of letting die (if not painfully)
		* The Oregon Death with Dignity Act allows for a lethal prescription to be written for the patient to take on their own will
			* The prescription is necessary but the HCP does not take an active part in the death; the patient can choose to take it
