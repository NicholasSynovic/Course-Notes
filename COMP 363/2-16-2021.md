## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Stacks and Call Stacks

- Call stacks are code, commands, and logic that the computer executes from a stack of instructions
  - Every command is allocated a slot in memory where it is waiting to be called
  - LIFO

### Sequential Execution vs Event Management

### Sever Side Considerations - Node.js

- Node.js is a JS runtime environment
  - Ran outside of the browser
  - General purpose utility
    - Asset compilation
    - Monitoring
    - Scripting
    - Web servers
  - Moves client side JS to server side JS
- Node.js is fast
  - Uses an event-based architecture
  - Doesn't uses a threading model
  - Signle event thread by default
  - All I/O is asynchronous

#### Conceptual Model for Processing in Node.js

1. Client sends HTTP request to Node.js server

- Event loop is then informed by the host OS
  - Passes request and response objects as JS closures which got o an associated worker functions with callbacks

2. Long running jobs continue t orun on various assigned worker threads

- Responses are sent from the finished workers back to the main event loop via a callback

3. Event loop returns any results bck to the client once process is complete

#### Threaded Architecture

- Concurrency allows for multiple things to happen at the same time
- Size of a thread is normally a few MB of memory
  - Memory is the limit
  - Threading is resource expensive
- Inherently more complicated to develop platforms that are thread safe due to complexity
- JS is single threaded with events that allow for concurrency to occur

#### Event Driven Architecture

- JS originally designed to work within the confines of a web browser
  - Single threaded
  - If a process took too long, it would lock up the webpage
- Event drive architecture added to other languages via packages
  - Akka for Java
  - EventMachine for Ruby
  - Twisted for Python

#### Callbacks

- In most languages an I/O query is sent and the system waits for a result
  - JS rarely does this
- JS passes I/O calls via callbacks
  - A callback will run once a task is completed
  - Allows for Node.js to scale
    - Node.js is suited for I/O heavy and intense tasks

### Recursion and the Call Stack

- Stacks can record an execution
  - Ordered
- Call stack is costly for recursive functions
- Adding info to the call stack requires memory usage
- If an application keeps crashing
  - Switch recursion to iteration
  - Use a cache for certain functions and function calls
  - Use tail recursion
