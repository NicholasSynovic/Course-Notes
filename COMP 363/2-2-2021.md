## Deleting Nodes from a LinkedList

- Need to make sure that all pointers remain valid
  - Delete index 3, need to make sure that index 2 points to index 4
    - Assuming that index 2 originally pointed to index 3
- Need to make sure that the null case and if the index is less than zero special cases are defined
- Need to make sure that it can handle a single node list
  - Returns null and empties the list

## Big O Complexities for LinkedList

- deleteNode() == getNode()
  - O(1) for the first node
  - O(n) for the last node

## Nature of Iterables

- Iterability requires that there are data sources and data consumers
  - Data sources are `arrays` and other data structures
  - Data consumers are for `loops` and `while` loops for example

## Simplifying Big O

- If it is O(2n) -> O(n)
  - Drop the non-dominant terms
  - If it is O(n^2 + n) -> O(n^2)
- If it is O(b^2 + a) then nothing can happen as we do not know what values are b and a

## Array vs LinkedList Usage Preference

- Context matters
  - Sequential access = LinkedList
  - Random access = arrays

## System and Memory

- Algorithms need to consider how an OS handles memory
  - An algorithm cannot exceed the amount of memory in the system or the amount of memory that an OS can handle
- Every process that is created by a program is assigned a space in memory
  - This space can be spread across the entire system and not in one point
- Every process can have a related state that is monittored by the kernel
- Process managers are responsible for system processes
  - Creates and destroys
  - Resource allocation and protection
  - Cooperation with device manager to implement I/O
  - Implementation of memory address space
  - Prcess scheduling
    - Maintained by the system's kernel
      - Responsible for switching processes and choosing the next process to run on CPU
        - Determined by process properties and by the nature of the process itself
          - I/O bound or CPU bound considerations are made
        - Algorithms choose these such as:
          - First come, first serve
          - Shortest job
          - Round robin
          - Multi-level priority queue
      - Meant to be fast and efficient
