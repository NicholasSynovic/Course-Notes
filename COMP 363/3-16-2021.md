## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Binary Search Trees

- A binary search tree is a binary tree where each node as a comparable key and associated value
  - A key is larger than the keys in all nodes to that specific node's left subtree
  - Smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right subtree
- Binary search works with sorted datasets
- Everytime we add or update the data we need to resort the list before using binary search
  - Everytime an item is deleted the entire tree needs to be shifted or a value that references a deleted value needs to be appended to that porition of the tree
- Searching for a node in a binary search tree takes O(log n) on average
  - O(n) for worst case
    - A sorted array takes O(log n) in the worst case
- A sorted binary search tree is faster for insertions and deletions

### Binary Search Tree Issues

- Some issues are that:
  - They do not provide random access
  - Performance times are averages and rely on a balanced tree
  - Specialist trees may provide self balancing mechanisms
    - Might use a red-balck trees

### Binary Search Tree Basic Logic Implementation

- Symbol table API for a binary search tree
  - Also known as a map, dictionary, associatative array, etc.
  - Has abastraction of key value pairs
    - Given a key, return a known value

### Binary Search Tree Order Based Methods

- Binary Search Trees keep keys in order
  - Ensure consistent I/O structure
- `min` = returns the smallest key-value pair between the immediate left, right, and current node
- `max` = returns the max key-value pair between the immediate left, right, and current node
- `floor` = if the value is less than the current node, append to the left. If the value is greater than the current node, append to the right. If the value is equivalent to the current node, do nothing.
- `ceiling` = same as `floor` but starts on the right side of the tree
- `selection` = Seek key of rank *k* and that other keys are smaller than *k*. If the number of keys *t* in the left subtree is larger than *k*, look for the key of rank *k* in the left subtree. If *t* = *k* return the key at the root node. If *t* is less than *k*, look for key of rank *k - t - 1* in the right subtree.
- `keys` = returns all keys in a given range
  - Perform inorder traversal of the binary search tree

### Biary Search Tree Usage

- Binary search trees has a non linear insertion algorithm
  - Similar to a doubly linked list
    - Includes a set of sequentially linked records called nodes
      - Every node has a link field of:
        - Previous node
        - Next node
        - current Data
