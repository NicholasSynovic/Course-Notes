## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Tables

- A hash table stores data in an easily determined location
  - No need to search for an item
  - No ordering to maintain
  - Fast insertion and deletion
  - Requires additional memory to store hashes
- Objects in a Hash Table:
  - Has a unique key
  - Keys may be compared for equality
  - Keys are used to identify objects
- Methods for a hash table
  - Check for an empty or full table
  - Insertion
  - Retrive object at a key
  - Update an object at a key
    - Can be used to replace an object at a key
  - Delete object at a key
  - List each item in the current table

### Implementations of Table Data Structure

- Sorted Arrays
  - O(n) for a full or empty array in constant time
    - Size is variable
  - Insertion/ Insertion takes the same time as finding an element on average
  - Find an element
    - Crucial for all operations except traversal itself
    - Uses binary search = O(log n)
  - Retrieval and update take O(log n) time
- Binary search trees
  - Tree becomes deep and narrow
  - Unbalanced trees will have O(n) time for everything
  - Self-Balancing trees will have O(log n) time on average
    - Way too complex to implement and manage
- Hash tables
  - Provide the benefit for the table data structure
  - Takes up extra space compared to the other solutions

### Hash Tables

- A hash takes an object and returns a new, unique object representing that specific object
- Organising data with fast retrieval
- Common use of hash tables is lookup of associative data sets
- Used to cache applications
