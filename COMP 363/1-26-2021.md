## Big O

- Tells us the relative operations for each algorithm and dataset
  - How fast the algorithm is per task
- Notations: O log(n)
- Common performance times:
  - O(n) = linear time
  - O(log n) = logarithmic time
  - O(n * log n) = faster logarithmic time
  - O(n^2) = slow algorithm
  - O(n!) = very slow algorithm
    - The traveling salesman problem
- Runtime is not measured in seconds but in operation cycles

## Algorithms and Data Structures

- Algorithms are used to store, retrive, and manimpulate data
  - Algorithms rely on proper data structures to store data
- Arrays
  - A list of items stored contiguously in data
    - Stored one after the other
    - Indexed one after the other
  - Not always the best use for every programming language or computer system
    - Are slow to operate on and take up alot of space
  - Allow for quick access to data via the index
    - O(1) for reading due to the index
    - O(n) for insertion due to having the data being appended at the end of the array
      - Size and speed constraints on inserting into the middle
      - Speed constraints on deleting a value
- Linked List
  - Data may be stored anywhere in memory
  - Each item stores address of the next item in the list
    - Link together random memory addresses as a contguous structure
  - Requesting items from a linked list also provides information as to where the next item in the list would be at
    - Does not require the entire array to be slid down one index
    - Can add a new item anywhere in memory instead of appending it to the end
      - If there is space in memory, then there is space for a linked list
  - Often name is shortened to just list as a data structure in Python and Lisp
  - Linked lists are not effective if the information needs to be accessed out of order
    - O(n) for reading as the index of the next data point has to be read from the current index
    - O(1) for insertion because data can be inserted anywhere in the list
  - Linked list provide an easy way of inserting data into the middle of the list
    - Also O(1) for insertion
    - Also provide O(1) for deletion

## Iteration and Access

- Invarients are inductive assertions
  - A condition that is not modified or changed during the execution of a program or algoithm
    - i < 13 is an invarient
    - "array items are sorted" is an ivarient
- Loop Invariant
  - A condition that is true at the beginning and end of every iteration of a loop
    - "min equals minimum element in a[0], ..., a[i-1]" is a loop invarient

## Extra Notes on the Basics

### Basic Algorithms

- Binary Search
  - Common option for finding individual items in a larger dataset
  - Common in tree or graph based data structures
  - Start in the middle and then divide in half
  - Has the benefits of scale in that it can scale to larger datasets than the one provided

### Logarithms

- The opposite of exponets
  - 10^2 = 100
  - log_10(100) = 2
    - Log base 10 of 100
