- Data structures and algorithms work together to solve predertimed problems
  - Data structures store information for algorithms to work on
  - Common use for the two are searching and sorting data
  - Advanced usages include graph traversal and text manipulation
- Benefits of algoithms
  - They cover a wide scope of problems
  - Their application can be applied to many diverse disciplines
  - Inherent abstraction
- Algorithms are used everywhere
- Algorithms have their roots in mathmatics
- Consideration for Algorithms
  - Algorithms are a series of instruction for completing a defined task
    - All code that accepts an input and provides a defined output are analogous algorithms
    - Algorithms accept parameter and return a computed value
  - Algorithms come in many different shapes and sizes
  - Runtime complexity is computed using Big O
- Algorithms must be precise enough to be understood by developers and programmers
- Imperative vs Declartive programming
  - Imperative describes computation in terms of instruction that change the program or data state
    - Commonly defines step by step instructions
  - Declarative specifies what the program should accomplish without describing how to do it
    - Define the purpose and view of the program
- Questions to ask when reviewing algorithms
  - What is it meant to do?
    - Specification
      - Should formalise the essential or pertinent details
  - Does it actually do what it is meant to do?
    - Verification
      - The fact that na algorthm satisfies its specification may not be obvious
        - Need to consider formal verification
        - Testing on a few particular inputs may be enough to show that the algorithm is incorrect
  - How efficient is the algorithm?
    - Performance analysis
      - Performance is a measurement of how many resources an alogithm utilizes
