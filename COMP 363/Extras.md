## Note

- These documents were meant to be read in a specific order. I did not do that.

## Data Stores and APIs

- Databases allow for us to hold persistent data
  - MongoDB is a NoSQL database
  - We can use JS to write CRUD SQL commands

### What is NoSQL?

- Works like SQL, without SQL commands

### Resources

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [MongoDB - Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- [MongoDB Driver - up to v3.6](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/)
- [MongoDB Driver - latest](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/a)
- [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/)
- [Robo 3T - Download](https://robomongo.org/download)

## Design Mockups

### Application Appearance

- A prototype or mockup helps us plan and visualise an application's appearance and interface
  - High or low fidelity
  - Mockups do not specify behaviro
  - Prototypes are interactive software in their own right

### Hi-Fi Mockups

- Look like the finalized product
- Represent and visualise the appearance of the user interface
  - Allows us to test colors
- No actual interaction

### Hi-Fi Prototypes

- Act as an interactive application
  - Not the final application
  - A working simulation
- Rapid, working example of functional components of an app
- Code often sufficient to simulate and replicate results for a given action and scenario
  - No persistent data storage
  - May simply simulate and demonstrate action of saving the data
- Can be time consuming to produce

### Low-Fi mockups

- Rough sketch or outline
  - Referred to as wireframes
- Their simplicity can offer an inherent utility and speed of creation
- Not trying to recreate the exact look and feel of an app
  - More interested in layout of visual components and elements
- Quick to modify and update

### Rapid Prototyping

- Provides quick examples of an application's design
- Iterative design helps encourage feedback early in the design process
  - Consider what needs to be prototyped early and often
  - FINISH ME
