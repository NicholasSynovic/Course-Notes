## Hash Table

- Load factor is straightforward to consider and to calculate
  - Number of items in hash table / total number of slots
  - Measures usage and capacity of current hash table
    - Allows for developers to know if a data structure can handle a certain amount of data
    - You want the load factor to be less than 1
  - As load factor gets larger, the hash table needs to as well
- Resizing a hash table takes O(1)
- SHA's are used as keys for hash tables
  - Randomized string that is generated uniquely per object
  - Can be used to validate files, content, and passwords
  - Is one way
    - You can get a SHA from a string, but you can't get the object back from a SHA

## Graph

- Contains nodes and edges
  - If the edges have values assigned to one another, it is a weighted graph
  - Nodes are connected together by edges
  - One edge per node connection
- Can be used to find the most optimal path between two nodes
  - Breadth first search
