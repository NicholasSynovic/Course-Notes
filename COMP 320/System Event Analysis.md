## Overview

- Principal goal of information systems analysis is to state accurately users' requirements for a new information processing system
  - State requirments precisely, accurately, concisely, unambiguously, and understanably
  - Constrain development to do the right thing
- Initial step of System Event Analysis is a business event analysis which results in an event model presented as an event table
- Event analysis treats the system as a black box and views it from a stimulus response perspective
  - Identifies the events to whic the system is expected to respond, names the inputs and outputs, and identifies the actors
  - The system does nothing until it is triggered by an event
  - When an event occurs, the system responds as completely as possible
  - After the response is complete, the system waits until another event occurs
- Events are an occurence that take place at a specific time and triggers a predetermined response from our system
  - They are independent of one another
    - Does not mean that they are unrelated
  - Specified time does not mean known ahead or that it is asynchonous
  - Predetermined does not mean that the same event always causes the same response
  - External events are events outside of the system boundary
  - Internal events are events which occur inside the system boundary
  - Temporal events are events which occur at a specific time
