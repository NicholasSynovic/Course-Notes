# Systems Analysis and Design
- Why care about this?
    - Helpful for large projects
        - Large projects ususally require more time, people, and work across different skills and skill levels.
    - Jobs and Careers use this
        - Architects, Systems Specialists, Designers, Systems Analysts , and Sopftware and System Gods who understand these goals.
        - System Analysts work with abstract models in order to:
            - Understand existing systems
            - Simulate system behavior
            - Describe the requirments for a new system
        - System Analysts help solve business problems by applying information technology not only to production and service functions but also to improved monitoring, control. and decision support
        - Successful systems analysts possess interpersonal and communication skills as well as analytical and technical skills
            - The business case for a proposed system incorporates an analysts of the project's feasibility
        - System designers are responsible for the technical quality of the system design
            - Assure that the system is designed to satisfy all the requirements
        - Programmers are responsible for the construction of the system
        - Quality assurance staff monitor the development process and provide measurements and tests which are independent on the development team
- We will study Systems Analysis and System Design
    - Will help you move from programming small programs with few members to large projects with lots of people.
    - Will help make a system that has a long life span
- Humans cope with complexity by thinking in terms of systems
    - Systems is organized into its components which make up its striucture which is further sperated by its environment by a system boundary
- Models and System Diagrams show how a program:
    - Transmits information
    - Stores information
    - Transforms information
- The importance of an information processing system is to respond to what happens in the outside world by transforming inputs into the desired outputs.
- What is a system:
    - An interrelated set of components which are viewed as a whole
    - Made up of:
        - Components: Its basic parts
        - Structure: How the componnets are organized
        - Function: What the system does
        - Objectives: The human purposes served by the system
    - Has a boundary which separates it from its environment
        - Takes in interactions and information and performs its function only to output some new interaction with operators or another system
    - An interface describes an interaction between a system and its environment or between subsystems
        - The way which one system interacts with another system
- System Descriptions
    - Implementation Descriptions
        - Dependent on a specific technology
        - Physical descriptions
        - Non essential
        - Shows form
        - Implementation Dependent
    - Essential Descriptions
        - Independent of a specific technology
        - Logical descriptions
        - Essential
        - Shows content
        - Abstract
        - Implementation independent
- Participants in Systems Analysis and Design
    - Users
        - Principal group
    - Analysts
        - Principal group
        - Take in account the different interests and types of users
    - Designers
    - Programmers
    - Quality Assurance Specialists
- Best practice in system development uses a process which is iterative and incremental such as the Rational Unified Process
- First UML Diagram
    - It says to me that:
        - One Professor can teach multiple sections
        - That every section of a class is mapped to one department
        - That every department can have 0 or more sections of a class
        - That the department class schedule only has one department
        - That a department can have 0 or more classes
        - That a class can only be in one department
        - That a course can have 0 or more sections
    - The key parts are the:
        - Professor
        - Section
        - Course
        - Department
        - Department class schedule
    - An issue that I see with this is that sections are listed in the deparment class schedule and not courses

# Computer Systems Analysis and Design + Event Analysis
- Starting System Analysis
    - It is often not clear exactly what the system is
        - A system has:
            - Requirements
            - Events
            - A process of careful precise steps
    - Important to analyze a system to clarify differing views of what system should, could, must, or might do
        - Prevents delays of key decisions
    - The principal goal of information systms analysis is to state accurately users' requirements for a new information processing system
    - Six step process for object oriented analysis to produce:
        - Event model
        - Use case diagram
        - System sequence diagrams
        - Model of the problem domain
        - System operation contracts
- Requirments
    - The goal of information systems analysis is to state accurately users' requirements for a new information processing system
        - State requirements precisely accurately, concisely, unabiguously, and understandably
        - Constrain development to do the right thing
        - Specify essential and logical requirements
- The initial step is a business event analysis
    - Results in an event model
    - Event analysis treats the system as a black box and views it from a stimulus-response perspective
        - Powerful technique for breaking up a large or complex system into small, manageable, cohesive, independent parts
        - Identifies the events to which the system is expected to respond to
            - Names the inputs, outputs, and identifies the actors involved
    - Events are an occurrence which takes place at a specific time and triggers a predetermined response from the system
        - Events occur independently of each other
            - Does not mean that events are unrelated
            - does not mean that one event cannot typically or always follow another
        - Specified time does not mean that time is known ahead or to rule out asynchronous events
        - Predetermined does not mean that the same event always causes the same response
    - Names of events need to be precise
        - There is often a style guide containing this information
