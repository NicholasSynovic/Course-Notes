## Overview

- Humans cope with complexity by thinking in terms of systems
- Systems are organized into components and is seperated from the environment by a system boundary
- Systems:
  - Transmit information
  - Store information
  - Transform information
  - Respond to outside events
  - Output new information
  - Are an interrelated set of components that are viewed as a whole
    - Components are the basic parts of the system
- System components are structured, have a function, and have clear objectives
- An interface describes an interaction between a system and its environment or between subsystems

## System Descriptions

- Implementation Descriptions
  - Dependent on a specific implementation or technology
  - Called physical descriptions
  - Non essential
  - Shows form
  - Concrete and tangible
- Essential Descriptions
  - Independent of a specific implementation
  - Called logical descriptions
  - Essential
  - Shows content
  - Abstract

## Participants in System Analysis and Design

- Users
- Analyists
  - Need to plan for the different types of users using the system
  - Handles these responsibilities when designing a new system:
    - Understanding
    - Modeling
    - Communicating the requirements
  - Do not construct the system
    - Programmers construct the system
- Quality Assurance Staff
  - Monitor the development process and proviude measurements and tests which are independent of the development team
