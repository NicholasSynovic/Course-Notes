# Week 3
## Use Cases and System Thinking
- Use Cases and Use Case Narratives
    - Process of Requirmeent details and precision
    - Understanding of the system and how it works
        - What it needs to do
        - Relationship between steps and actions
    - Works for both developer and customer
    - Use Case Diagrams show the use cases within the scoper of the system and the actors in the environment with which each use case is associated
        - For every use case there is at least one narrative
            - Narraticves shows what the system must do to respond to a specifici event
        - Expanded use case narratives are written for every use case corresponding to an external event
    - Are essentail for analysis
- System Sequence Diagram
    - Graphically shows the sequence, structure, and content of each message from an actor to the system
    - One system sequence diagram for each use case corresponding to an external event
- Use Case Heuristic
    - Nothing Missing from a use case
        - Includes all cases, alternatives, options, errors, and recoveries
            - No duplicate or similar cases
            - Every case should add some unique information
- A use case is the sequence of actions which occur when an actor uses a system to complete a process
    - A use case is a model of a requirement
    - A use case name is a short phrase beginning with a verb
    - Each event corresponds to at least one use case
    - Represented in UML as an oval
- Actors are a person, organization, or system which interacts with a system by sending messages to the system or reveiving messages from said system
    - Actors play roles with respect to the system
    - Actors are identified during event analysis
    - Initating actors initalizes a use case by starting an external event
        - Has an arrow drawn from the actor to the input use case
    - A participating actor is involved in a use case but does not initalize it
        - Often recieves the output
        - Has a line drawn from the output use case to the actor in UML
    - Represented in UML as a stick figure with a name
- Use Case Narratives
    - Preconditions
        - A condition which must be true for the use case to begin and produce the desired results
        - Assumptions for this part of the system
        - Guaranteed to be met by something else
        - System set up to be se sure they are met
    - Postconditions
        - A condition which must be true after the use case has been completed
        - What is promised to those coming later
        - System state
        - May be the precondition to something else
    - Special Requirements
        - A requirement which is critical to a user's acceptance and use of the system
    - Alternative Flow of Events
        - What the system should do in the case of exceptional conditions or errors
- Associations Between Use Cases
    - <<includes>> association always occurs when the use case which includes it occurs
        - Or statement between use cases
    - <<extends>> association depends on a true condition in the use case which it extends
