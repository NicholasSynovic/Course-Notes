## Intro

- After Hurrican Charley roared out of the Gulf of Mexico in the summer of 2004, price gouging on affected victims began
  - Victims were outraged
    - Argued that they did not enter the economic market in a fair manner to appreciate the costs of goods
  - Economists argued that the prices were fair
    - Based on a just price determined by supply and demand
      - As supply drops and demmand rises, prices will rise
    - Based on the idea that buyers and sellers enter the market freely

## Welfare, Freedom, and Virtue

- Arguementes surrounding price gouging rely on the the three ideas of:

1. Maximizing welfare
2. Respecting freedom
3. Promoting virtue

- Arguements surrounding virtue involve moral dilemmas
  - People are always worried about arguements of virtue being enacted as laws

- Those *for* price gouging / free markets argue that:

1. Markets maximize welfare
2. Markets respect individual freedoms by allowing people to set the prices for goods and services
3. The markets promote the welfare of society as a whole

- Those *against* price gouging / constrained markets (markets were rules are imposed on it) argue that:

1. The welfare of society is not served by the exorbitant prices charged in hard times
2. The free market might not always be free in that buyers under duress have no freedom
3. Greed is a vice that makes people oblivous to the suffering of others

- Definition of *outrage*:
  - A special kind of anger you feel when you believe that people are gettng things they don't deserve

- One of the largest questions in philosphy is: *Does a just society seek to promote the virtue of its citizens? Or should law be neutral toward competing conceptions of virture, so that citizens can be free to choose for themselves the best way to live?*
  - Aristotle says that virtue involves giving people what they deserve
    - To do so, one has to define what is honorable and virtous
      - Involves defining what is not honorable and virtous
  - Modern philosophers argue that notions of the law should not be rested upon a bed of virtue
    - A just society respects each person's freedom to choose their own conception of the good life

## What Wounds Deserve the Purple Heart?

- A moral dilema where what is honor and what isn't has to be defined
- The Purple Heart is awarded to soliders wounded or killed in action by the U.S. Military
  - PTSD is not included in the list of recognized honorable deeds, yet it is the most common symptom of war
    - PTSD is not directly caused by conflict and can be difficult to diagnose objectively
  - Most common injury that is awarded is a ruptured eardrum
    - They are not directly caused by conflict
- Arguements for awarding the Purple Heart to PTSD victims base it in that physical injureis caused by the side effects of conflict get the medal, so why not phsycological injuries?
- Arugements against base it in that shedding blood is the qualification for the medal
  - Comes from the tough mentality of the military

## Bailout Outrage

- The 2008 stock market crash caused many big Wall Street firms to rely on government bailouts to get through
  - Some firms gave bonuses to their employees who helped orchestrate the crash
  - The public was outraged
    - Eventually some of the money was returned back to the firm to be put to use in restoring the economy
- Those that supported the bonuses based it on similar actions taken in previous years to award members of hte firm who were successful
  - The failure was not their fault as they could not have predicted the market forces in play
- Those that were against the bonuses based it on that the members of the firm were being awarded for failure
  - These rewards were being subsizdized by the US taxpayers as well

## Three Approaches to Justice

- To ask if a society is just is to ask how it distributes the things we prize
  - Goods are distributed based off of how much each person gives their due
  - The hard part is determining how much people due owe.

- Different approaches to Justice

1. Maximize welfare
2. Connect justice to freedom
3. Justice = Virtue and the "Good Life"

## The Runaway Trolley

- A hypothetical where you blatently kill someone to save three, or let three die and due to your negligence
  - A moral dilemma that arrizes by your intentions with what to do
    - Moral dilemmas arise from conflicting moral principles or because we are uncertain how the situation will play out

## The Afghan Goatherds

- Situation where the moral decision was made without knowing the outcome
  - Soliders had to kill some captured men in enemy territory or let them live
    - Released them, the now free men reported them to the enemy and the soliders died

## Moral Dilemmas

- Moral dilemmas can change minds and spark discussion that leads to productive answers

- Moral thinking involves:

1. Starting with a conviction or opinion
2. Reflection on the reason behind the conviction
3. Confront yourself with a situation that confounds the principle
4. Start philisophising
5. Discuss with others about your new philosophy on the situation

- Plato argues that to grasp the meaning of justice we must rise above the prejudices and routines of everyday life
  - Moral reflection request opinions and convictions in order to find concrete answers to situations
