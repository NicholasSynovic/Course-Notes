## Intro

- Three sailors ate a cabin boy after their food had ran out, they were arrested and tried once they had been recovered
  - They argued that given the circumstances, it was a neccisity that they kill one to save three
  - Counterarguementes were that:
    - Do the benefits of killing the cabin boy outweigh the costs?
      - Allowing the killing only promotes others to kill in similar situations
      - This implies that morality involves the consequences to society of a whole
        - The rights and wrongs of society
    - Isn't it wrong to do so for reasons that go beyond the calculation of social costs and benefits?
      - This implies that morality involves more than just calculating what is wrong or right
  - To find an answer, one must ask if morality is a matter of countinglives and weighing costs and benefits or are there certain fundamental human rights that cannot be crossed.

## Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarianism

- Jeremy Bentham scorned natural rights
  - Invinted Utilitarianism
    - Created a number of ideas to support his moral theory
      - The Panopticon was a prison that was gaurded by private contractors that were paid by the prisoners labor. Prisoners worked 16hr days
      - The Pauper Management Plan was meant to take people off of the street and put them in a home where they would work to pay off their social debts
        - Based off of the idea that seeing a begger in the street causes more people to be unhappy than happy, and the solution should therfore be to round up the beggers
      - Ideas were meant not to punish, but to improve social utility
  - People say they have rights, but the root cause is because over time supporting these rights will lead to the greatest happiness
- Utilitarianism is about maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people
  - Humans' soverign masters are pleasure and pain
  - Community is a fictitous body
    - Laws should be made to provide the greatest happiness to the most amount of people
    - To determine if a law is good, sum up all of the good and subtract all of the bad outcomes and the result is the answer to that question.
      - If there is more bad than good, then it is a bad law
      - **Greatest happiness principle** at play

### Objections

- Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarianism does not support individual rights and therefore violates decency and individual respect
  - Lookup, *The Ones Who Walked Away* by Ursula K. Le Guin
- Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarianism expects everyone's and everything's social utility to be measured on the same scale of equality.
  - Some argue that not all moral arguements are equal
    - To kill or not to kill? To eat or not to eat? To learn or not learn? cannont all be answered on the same moral scale

## John Stuart Mill

- Tried to reinvent Utilitarianism to be less cold and calculating as Jeremy Bentham had
  - Second generation Utilitarian
- People should be free to do whatever they want as long as it does not harm others
  - The government cannont interve with an individuals life, only with matters that affect others
- Wants to maximize utility in the long run
  - Prevents a majority religion from wiping out a minority religion
  - The end goal of his utility is to maximize the character of humans as well
    - It is comforting to live a life behind rules and regulations, but this would void the individual rights of the individual. Therefore, the individual must have the freedom to puruse their life to the fullest exten.
      - This idea surpasses Utilitarianism
- Can address the common currency issue by because if out of two pleasures, one is more commonly desired than the other, than it is the higher pleasure
  - It is ok to occasionaly slip into the lower pleasure occasionally as well
