## Intro

- Three sailors ate a cabin boy after their food had ran out, they were arrested and tried once they had been recovered
  - They argued that given the circumstances, it was a neccisity that they kill one to save three
  - Counterarguementes were that:
    - Do the benefits of killing the cabin boy outweigh the costs?
      - Allowing the killing only promotes others to kill in similar situations
      - This implies that morality involves the consequences to society of a whole
        - The rights and wrongs of society
    - Isn't it wrong to do so for reasons that go beyond the calculation of social costs and benefits?
      - This implies that morality involves more than just calculating what is wrong or right
  - To find an answer, one must ask if morality is a matter of countinglives and weighing costs and benefits or are there certain fundamental human rights that cannot be crossed.
