# Systems Analysis and Design
- Why care about this?
    - Helpful for large projects
        - Large projects ususally require more time, people, and work across different skills and skill levels.
    - Jobs and Careers use this
        - Architects, Systems Specialists, Designers, Systems Analysts , and Sopftware and System Gods who understand these goals.
        - System Analysts work with abstract models in order to:
            - Understand existing systems
            - Simulate system behavior
            - Describe the requirments for a new system
        - System Analysts help solve business problems by applying information technology not only to production and service functions but also to improved monitoring, control. and decision support
        - Successful systems analysts possess interpersonal and communication skills as well as analytical and technical skills
            - The business case for a proposed system incorporates an analysts of the project's feasibility
        - System designers are responsible for the technical quality of the system design
            - Assure that the system is designed to satisfy all the requirements
        - Programmers are responsible for the construction of the system
        - Quality assurance staff monitor the development process and provide measurements and tests which are independent on the development team
- We will study Systems Analysis and System Design
    - Will help you move from programming small programs with few members to large projects with lots of people.
    - Will help make a system that has a long life span
- Humans cope with complexity by thinking in terms of systems
    - Systems is organized into its components which make up its striucture which is further sperated by its environment by a system boundary
- Models and System Diagrams show how a program:
    - Transmits information
    - Stores information
    - Transforms information
- The importance of an information processing system is to respond to what happens in the outside world by transforming inputs into the desired outputs.
- What is a system:
    - An interrelated set of components which are viewed as a whole
    - Made up of:
        - Components: Its basic parts
        - Structure: How the componnets are organized
        - Function: What the system does
        - Objectives: The human purposes served by the system
    - Has a boundary which separates it from its environment
        - Takes in interactions and information and performs its function only to output some new interaction with operators or another system
    - An interface describes an interaction between a system and its environment or between subsystems
        - The way which one system interacts with another system
- System Descriptions
    - Implementation Descriptions
        - Dependent on a specific technology
        - Physical descriptions
        - Non essential
        - Shows form
        - Implementation Dependent
    - Essential Descriptions
        - Independent of a specific technology
        - Logical descriptions
        - Essential
        - Shows content
        - Abstract
        - Implementation independent
- Participants in Systems Analysis and Design
    - Users
        - Principal group
    - Analysts
        - Principal group
        - Take in account the different interests and types of users
    - Designers
    - Programmers
    - Quality Assurance Specialists
- Best practice in system development uses a process which is iterative and incremental such as the Rational Unified Process
- First UML Diagram
    - It says to me that:
        - One Professor can teach multiple sections
        - That every section of a class is mapped to one department
        - That every department can have 0 or more sections of a class
        - That the department class schedule only has one department
        - That a department can have 0 or more classes
        - That a class can only be in one department
        - That a course can have 0 or more sections
    - The key parts are the:
        - Professor
        - Section
        - Course
        - Department
        - Department class schedule
    - An issue that I see with this is that sections are listed in the deparment class schedule and not courses
