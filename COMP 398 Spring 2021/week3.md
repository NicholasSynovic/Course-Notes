# Week 3

## Monday
- Daniel seems like a competent guy. I hope that he turns out to be a good programmer. This is his first time working with the librairies that I am using so I'll limit my expectations for this week.
- I have made some work on the libraries of the backend.
    - Now have an accessor method to make a BeautifulSoup object out of any page from Congress.gov
    - I have cloned the code from the Metrics Dashboard databaseConnector.py file into the project to simplify the storing of data.
- Looking at the Congress.gov search feature, there is an option to save the first 1000 responses of a search.
    - I do not think that this will help in my research.
        - While useful, the data will need to be converted into a .db file anyway
