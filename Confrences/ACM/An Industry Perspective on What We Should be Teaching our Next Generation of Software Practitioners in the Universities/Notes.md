## Traditional Software Engineering Education vs Real World

- Student's aren't taught how to teach their own method of software engineering
  - Industry won't tell them to do so as well
    - Will tell them to use whatever method the company is currently using
  - By teaching one or more methods in the university, the industry probably won't use them
  - The first challenge of leaving university will be to learn the method used by the industry
  - The second challenge will be how to improve an existing method
- Student's should be taught how to improve an existing method
  - How this can be taught via the Essence Framework

## Essence Framework

- An Object Management Group standard
  - Developed by volunteers
- A kernel and language for software engingeering method
- **Not a method**
  - More like a common ground of essentials underlying all methods
- Contains 7 Alphas
  - Each has 5 or 6 states
  - Each state characterized by a list of checklist items
    - Checklists come from real world experience
  - Essence can sound like it goes against agile development, however it is meant to work in conjucture with agile
- Guidelines used in transforming real life stories into Essence checklists
  - Used natural language
    - Alpha is the only technical term
  - Do not make them check the box checklists
    - Intentionally worded to elicit conversation
    - Teams decide on interpretation given context
      - The word timely is something that can be interpreted
      - The stakeholder being in agreement is often misinterpreted
        - In agreement means that minimal expectations agreed, rep's are happy with their involvement, rep's input is valid, team's input valued, and priorities are clear and perspectives balanced
- SCRUM can help with Essence
  - 1/3rd of the time it is implemented properly
  - 1/3rd of the time it is implemented poorly
  - 1/3rd of the time it is not implemented

### Examples of Using the Essence Framework

- Meant to provide context on how to do a root cause analysis to arrive at an optimal solution

1. We are akways dealing with unclear requirements
2. We can't get out stakeholders to work with us
3. The hardware is arriving late

- Case Study of Essence in Stealth Mode

1. Client explains the problem
2. Alphas figured out

- Stakeholders
- Software Systems

3. Client states that when we change something for one client, we break something for the other client.
4. Checklists thought of

- System functionality tested
- Defect levels acceptable

### Essence Education Forum

- In university requirements are provided and software is expected to be developed to match those requirements
- The gap is that there is no real stake holders or amiguous reqirements

## Presenter Background

- Developed the essence checklist with insights from industry
