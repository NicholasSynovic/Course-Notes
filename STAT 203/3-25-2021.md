## Recap

## Normal Distribution

- Symetric
  - About the mean
    - Makes the mean the median and mode of x
- Bell shaped curve
  - f(x)
    - -infinity < x < infinity
- A continous random variable has two parameters
  - Mean and Variance
- Normal CDF is represented by Phi
  - Use the table to calculate of probabilities
- Theorem
  - For any X in N(mean, varience) take (X - mean) / standard deviation to get the Z score
    - Called the Z score because it it is the Z value
      - Probabilities can then find the probabilities of the Z value from the table
    - P(a < x < b) -> P([a - mean] / standard deviation < Z < [b - mean] / standard deviation)

### Nth Percentile of X

- Xp is the Nth percentile of X -> N(mean, varience)
- Zp is the Nth percentile of Z -> N(0, 1)
- Zp = mean + standard deviation * Zp

## Special Case Standard Normal Distribution

- Called a Z distribution
  - Normal distribution where the parameters are (0, 1)
    - Mean is 0
    - Varience is 1
- When asked to find Z, you are looking to find a percentile
  - Use the CDF to find the probabilty of Z, then back track to the corresponding Z value in column 1 and the current column
- When asked to find the bounds of Z, take the sum of the bounds, divide by 4 to find the probability of Z, then go to the table and find the Z value

### Empirical Rule

- Says that for any normal distribution almost all of the data will between += 3 varience
  - +- the varience covers 68%
  - +- 2 varience covers 95%
  - +- 3 varience covers 99%

### How to Use a Normal Table

- Find P(Z <= a)
  - Z values are in column 1
  - 2nd deciomal points in Z value in column 2
