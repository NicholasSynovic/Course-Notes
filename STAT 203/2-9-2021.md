## Review

- Disjoint means that events A and B can never happen simultanously
  - Contradictory to Independent events
- Independent events means that the probability of one remains unchanged with the information of occurance of another event
  - Used in conditional probability
- Consider two events A abnd B such that o < P(A) and P(B) < 1
  - A and B are disjoint => A and B are dependent events
  - Proof
    - Let A and B be disjoint events. Then P(A X B) = 0
    - Now lets assume A and B are independent events. Then P(A X B) = P(A) * P(B) > 0
    - Since P(A X B) > 0 and disjoint events = 0, then there is a contradiction and our assumption is incorrect. A and B are dependent events

## Compliments in Conditional Probability

- P(A' | B) = 1 - P(A | B)
  - Recall P(A') = 1 - P(A)
- Additive Rule
  - P (A U B | C) = P(A | C) + P(B | C) - P(A x B | C)

## Law of Total Probability

- S = B1 U B2 U B3 U B4 U ...
  - Bn is a partition
    - Paritions are a sequence of evnets that make up a sample  S if Bi X Bj = null  which means that they are pairwise disjoint
    - All events are disjoint and do not overlap with one another
- Law of Total Probability
  - P(A), where A is an event that spans multiple partitions, = P(B1) * P(A | B1) + P(B2) * P(A | B2) + P(B3) * P(A | B3) + ...

## Bayes Theorum

- Looking at a group of partitions, what is the probability that an event occured within a given partition
  - Combination of Multiplicative Rule and Law of Total Probability
  - P(Bn | A) = P(Bn X A) / P(A)
    - Law of total probability is used in the deonminator
