## Chapter 4: Continous Probability Distributions

- Continous random variables
  - Where x is discrete
    - P(1 <= x <= 3>) = P(x = 1) + P(x = 2) + P(x = 3)
  - Where x is continous
    - Probability is defined as the area under the curve
    - P(1 <= x <= 3>) = the integral from 1 to 3 of f(x)dx
- Probability Function
  - Probability Mass Function = Chapter 3
  - Probability Density Function (pdf) = Chapter 4
    - f(x) >= 0 for all x
    - the integral of the f(x)dx from negative infinity to positive infinity = 1
- Interpreting Probability
  - Always done between an inequality
  - If it is an equality, then the integral of f(x) = 0
    - If the random variable x is continous, and y is any value, P(x = y) = 0
- Cumulative Distribution Function
  - F(x) = P(X <= x)
  - F(x) = the integral from negative infinity to x of f(t)dt
    - Not using x as x is already being used as a variable for the integral
  - f(x) = d/dx F(x)
- Uniform Distribution
  - f(x) =
    - (1 / b - a) if a < x < b
    - 0 otherwise

## Mean and Variance of X

- Mean = E(x) = the integral from negative infinity to infinity of (x)(f(x))dx
- Varience = V(x) = E(x^2) - mean^2
