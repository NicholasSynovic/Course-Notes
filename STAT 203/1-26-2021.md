# Review
- Types of Sampling
- Different Shapes of Graphs
- Graphical Representations
    - Stem and Leaf plots
    - Histograms
        - Frequency distribution leads to class intervals
            - Intervals are continous
            - Class intervals that are not uniform can play down the importance of data
        - Histogram bars touch each other
            - Do not include the last value
                - 0 to 3 exclusive of 3

# New Information
- Relative Frequency = Frequency of Condition / Total Frequency

# Measurements of Location
- Where is the data is centered/ located?
    - Sample Mean
        - Notations: X, x -> Variable
        - Sample data on x is x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n where n is the size of the sample
        - See [today's pdf](1-26-2021.pdf) for equation to calculate Sample Mean
        - If every value is multiplied by a constant, then the equation is simply multiplied by ten
    - Trimmed Mean
        - X% of data is chopped off from each tail of the data
        - Does not changes the Sample Mean
    - Sample Median
        - Middle Value that the data splits into
            - Middle value is where there are two equal halfs on either side of that number
        - Data has to sorted
        - See [today's pdf](1-26-2021.pdf) for notation and infromation
        - If every value is multiplied by a constant, then the equation is simply multiplied by ten
    - Sample Mode
        - Most frequent value in the data
        - If there is an equivalent frequency of values in the dataset, then there is either no mode or every value is the mode
            - Both are acceptable answers
            - Mode should not be considered when looking at a dataset
        - Notation: x_max
    - Quartiles
        - Split the data into 4 equal parts
        - See [today's pdf](1-26-2021.pdf) for more information

# Measures of Spread
- Range = Maximum Value of the Dataset - Minimum Value of the Dataset
- Mean Deviation
    - It can be done on mean and median
        - Mean: Xi - Mean
            - Always equal to 0
            - Not a very good stat to consider
        - Median: Xi - Median
            - Not very common
    - Calculates how far each value is from the average
