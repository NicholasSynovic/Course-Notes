## Exponential Distribution or Life Time Distribution

- Extremely skewed in one direction
- pdf = f(x; lambda) =
  - lambda * e^(-lambda * x)    for 0 < x < infinity
  - 0                           otherwise
- Lambda measures the steepness
- CDF is used to calculate probabilities
  - CDF = 1 - e^(-lambda * x)
    - F(x) =
      - 0                     for x < 0
      - 1 - e^(-lambda * x)   for x >= 0

### Memoryless Property

- Examples Question:
  - Given that a product has lasted 3hrs, what is the probability that it will last 2 more hours
  - P(x >= 5 | x >= 3) = P(x >= 2 | x >= 3) = P(x >= 2)
  - x >= 5 is a subset of x >= 3
    - The larger value is always the subset of the smaller value
- P(x >= t0 + t | x >= t0) = P(x >= t0 + t intersected with X >= t0) / P(x >= t0)
  - -> P(x >= t0 + t) / P(x >= t0)
    - -> 1 - F(t0 + t) / [1 - F(t0)]
- t0 is the original value
- t is the value being added on to t0
  - In the Example, t = 2, t0 = 3

### Special Case Gamma Distribution

- Not going to be studied

## The Chi-Squared Distribution

- Will be covered later on
