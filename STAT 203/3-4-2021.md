## Review

- Negative Binomial Distribution
  - Number of successes constant, number of trials are random
  - Mo distribution table
  - Varience is larger than the mean which is uncommon

## Negative Binomial Distribution Special Case

- Geometric Distribution
  - It is were *r* = 1
  - p(x) = (p^r) * (1-p)
  - E(x) = (1 - p) / p
  - v(x) = (1 - p) / p^2

## Poisson Distribution

- p(x) = ((e^-u) * (u^x)) / x!
  - Where u is the Greek symbol meu
  - There is a continous distributation form table
- E(x) = u
- v(x) = u
