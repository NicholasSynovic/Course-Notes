## Review

- A random variable is a population idea
- Captial X represents a population
- Lowercase x represents a sample

## Exact Probability

- P(x = x) = probability mass function
  - Given in a table, in words, function, distribution, or via software

## Inequalities

- P(X <= x) = f(x) use Cumalitive distribution function, table, given in table
- P(X < x) = P(X <= x - 1) = f(x - 1)
- P(x >= x) = 1 - P(X <= x - 1)

## Expected Values and Population Mean

- Expected Value and Population Mean = Summation of (x * p(x)) = E(x)
- The expected value of any constant is the constant
  - You can pull a constant out in front of the summation
    - E(ax) = a * E(x)
    - E(x + a) = E(x) + a

## Population Varience

- Population Varience = E(x - u)^2
  - Where u is the population mean
- Working formula = E(x^2) - u^2
