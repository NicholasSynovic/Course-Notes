## Review

- A random variable is a population idea

## Exact Probability

- P(x = x) = probability mass function
  - Given in a table, in words, function, distribution, or via software

## Inequalities

- P(X <= x) = f(x) use Cumalitive distribution function, table, given in table
- P(X < x) = P(X <= x - 1) = f(x - 1)
- P(x >= x) = 1 - P(X <= x - 1)
