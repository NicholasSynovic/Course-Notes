- Went over syllabus

# Parts of a Stats Study

- Population: A large portion of a group that is inaccassible due to time or energy
    - Population of Chicago is impossible to measure because it would take too much energy

- Sample: A porition of the population that is choosen via some method to conduct the study against

- Variable(s): The thing that we are testing for
    - Continous Variable(s)
    - Discrete Variable(s)

- Data: The information that we collect about the variable(s) from the sample
    - Primary Data: Data that a researcher directly takes
    - Seconday Data: Data that is taken from a study or from another researcher

- Data Analysis: How to answer a research question
    - Descriptive Data Analysis: Preliminary Statistics, the basis for Inferential Statistics
    - Inferential Statistics:

- How to answer a research question via the data analysis
    - Estimation: The data collected from a sample (73 said yes out of 100)
    - Hypothesis Test
    - Finding a Confidence Interval: Similar to estimation but give an interval over several numbers

- Statistical Results/ Theorms are discussed in Chapter 5

- Probability Distributions: Descriptions of data and its characteristics
    - Probability Distributions = Distributions

- Probability is covered in Chapter 2
