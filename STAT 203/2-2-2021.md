## Set Theory

- An intersection is everything in events A and B
  - Maked with an upside down U but in the notes is marked with an X
- Venn Diagrams are used to represent Intersections, Unions, and Compliments
- Compliments, Unions, and Intersections can be stacked using ()
  - (A U B)' is the Compliment of the Union of Events A and B
- Disjoint sets are when two events have no common outcomes
  - Also known as Mutually Exclusive
  - A and A' is always Disjoint
- An Empty / Null Set is a set with no outcomes
  - Marked with {}
  - {}' is S
  - Distributive Law
    - A U (B X C) = (A U B) X (A U C)
    - A X (B U C) = (A X B) U (A X C)

## Probability

- P(A) = (Number of outcome that Favor A) / (Total Number of Outcomes)
  - 1 <= P(A) => 0
  - P(S) = 1
- Union of all Disjoint Sets is the Summation of the probablity of a given solution of all disjoint sets
  - P(A U A') = P(A) + P(A') -> A U A' = S -> P(S) = 1 -> **P(A U A') = P(S) = 1**
    - **P(A') = 1 - P(A)**
- If A and B are not disjoint:
  - P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A X B)
  - Called the Additive Rule
  - Special Case if A and B are disjoint
    - P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0
  - Triple Union Additive Rule
    - P(A U B U C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A X B) - P(A X C) - P(B X C) + P(A X B X C)

## How to Calculate Probability

- Combinatrics
  - Ways to choose K objects from N objects
    - K is a subset of objects from N where order does not matter
    - C(k, n) = n! / [k! (n - k)!]
    - Order does not matter
      - EX: Select 9 players from a total of 15 players
      - EX: Lottery numbers are drawn at random and the same number can be drawn multiple times
      - EX: The coins in a pocket can be (D, D, D, P, P, Q, Q) which is a combination of coins
- Permutations
  - Number of ways to order K objects from N objects
    - P(k, n) = n! / (n - k)!
    - Order matters
      - EX: The code of numbers used to open a locker is a permutation
- Product Rule
  - Looks like an expanding tree structure
