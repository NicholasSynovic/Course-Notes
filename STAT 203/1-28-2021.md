## Location and Scale Change Effects on Variance and Standard Deviation

- Location Change
  - Changing all values of a dataset/sample by a constant
    - Adding or subtracting 2 from every value
  - Does Varience change?
    - No, as all numbers are changed by a constant, the interrelationship between the numbers does not change at all
  - Does Standard Deviation change?
  - No
- Scale Change
  - Changing all values of a dataset/ sample by a constant
    - Multiplying or dividing 2 from every value
  - Does Variance change?
    - Yes it does as the spread from the mean is changed
  - Does Standard Deviation change?
    - Yes as the factor multiplies the standard deviation. See notes for formula

## Five Number/ Point Summary

- Five properties of the data that gives a basic idea
    1. Minimum
    2. First Quartile
    3. Second Quartile
    4. Third Quartile
    5. Max
  - Graphical representation is a box plot/ box and wisker plot
    - Has inner and outer boundaries
      - Any value between these boundaries is considred suspicous and needs special attention
        - Marked with open circles
        - Values are called an influential observation
        - Can provide further information such as determining where a value is going towards
      - Any value outside the outer boundary is an outlier
        - Marked with stars
    - Minimum and Maximum values are not outliers
      - If a data point is added to the set after the fact, then it is either:
        1. In the IQR
        2. An Infludential Observation
        3. An Outlier
    - Shape of the data can be gauged by drawing the peak at the Second Quartile and the bottom of the slopes at the First and Third Quartile
      - Symmetric means the Second Quartile is in the middle
      - Positively Skewed means that the Second Quartile is further to the **left**
      - Negatively Skewed means that the Second Quartile is further to the **right**
    - See notes for an example)

## Interquartile Range (IQR)

- Third Quartile - First Quartile = IQR
  - The IQR can be affected by values that are less than the Third Quartile and greater than the First Quartile
- First Quartile - (1.5 * IQR) = Lower Inner Boundary
- Third Quartile + (1.5 * IQR) = Upper Inner Boundary
- First Quartile - (3 * IQR) = Lower Outer Boundary
- Third Quartile + (3 * IQR) = Uppper Outer Boundary

## Percentiles

- Very similar to Quartiles
  - 99 percentiles divide the data into 100 equal parts
    - EX: The 83rd percentile has 83% of the data on its left and 17% on its right

## Chapter 2: Probability

- S is the symbol for the Universal Set
  - A Universal Set is teh set of all possible outcomes
- Events can be of two types
  - Simple
    - Cannot be decomposed
      - {A} is a Simple Set
  - Compound
    - Can be decomposed
      - {A, B, C} is a Compound Set
- Set Operations
  - Compliment of an event A
    - Marked with an ' = A'
    - Set of outcomes that do not belong to an event A
      - Everything not included in an Event
  - Union
    - Set of all outcomes in event A or B or Both
    - Marked with a U
