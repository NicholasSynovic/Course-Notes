## Review

- Binomial Coefficents Permutations
  - Formula = n! / (n - k)! where there are only two objects that need to be considered
- Multinomial Coefficents Permutations
  - Formula = n! / (a! * b! * c!) where a, b, c are distinct objects and n is the total number of objects
  - Permuation Formula
    - n! / (a! * b! * c!)
- P(A) = # Outcomes that favor A / Total # of outcomes
- P(A') = 1 - P(A)
- P(A) >= 0
- P(S) = 1
- P(A1 U A2 U A3 U ...) = P(A1) + P(A2) + P(A3) + ...
- P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A X B)
  - If A and B are disjoint = P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)
- Product Rule
  - If event A can happen in N1 ways, and event B can happen in N2 ways, then there are N1 * N2 ways of A and B happening
- Combinations
  - (n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!)
- Permutations
  - (n, k) = n! / (n - k)!

## Conditional Probability

- Finding probabilities given the condition about another event
  - P(A | B) is read that given that B has already happened, what is now the probability that A will also happen
  - P(A | B) = P(A X B) / P(B)
- If A and B are independent of the chances of occurrence of one another, then they have no affect on the chances of occurrence of another
  - P(A | B) = P(A)
  - Check if independent
    - P(A x B) = P(A) * P(B)

## Multiplicative Rule

- Recall P(A | B) = P(A X B) / P(B)
  - P(B) * P(A | B) = P(A X B)
