## Recap

- Now on Chapter 4

### Continous Random Variables

- Instead of a discrete value, we are now measuring the area under the curve
  - Need to know the Probability Density Function (pdf)
    - Uses the Reiman Integral to find the curve
    - Integral of a to b of the pdf
- P(1 <= x <= 2) = P(1 < x < 2)
  - The instantanous probability is equal to zero
- F(x) = P(X <= x) -> F(x) = integral from -infity to x of f(t)dt
  - F(x) is the density
  - f(t) is the continous
  - Integrate F(x) to get f(t)
  - Derive f(t) to get F(x)
- Uniform Distribution of (a, b) is
  - 1 / (b - a) for a < x < b
  - 0           otherwise
  - F(b) = 1

### Mean, Median, Varience, and Standard Deviation

- mew is E(X) = the integral from -infinity to infinity of (x * f(x))dx
  - Varience is E(x^2) - mew^2
- Median is 50% of the data
  - Divides the data into two equal parts
- Standard Deviation is
