# Types of Sampling
- [See attached file for notes on the worksheet done in class today](1-21-2021.pdf)
- At least X means everything greater than X but not including X
- Whever it says proportion, do not answer in a percentage.
    - Fraction or decimal works
- Main purpose of statistical analysis is to explain variation in the data set
- Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
    - Randomly selected sample from a population
    - Random has to avoid bias
        - Can use software to find a pseudo random sample
        - If done properly it avoids bias
    - Not always the best option
        - Can cause an unfair comparison due to sample members having too many traits
    - Simple Random Sampling With Replacement (SRSWR)
        - The situation remains constant
    - Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWoR)
        - The situation changes
- Stratified Sampling
    - Strata are different levels choosen based off of the population's traits
    - Simple Random Sampling done on each strata
    - Meant to avoid implicit bias
- Convienience Sampling
    - NOT MEANT TO BE USED
    - Only select a sample that is most convient to the researcher
        - Quality control of bricks in a building by looking at the bricks closest to the QC member
- Variables is any characteristic whose value may change from one object to another in the population
    - The thing that is being measured in the stat
    - Univarient: Each sample point has one value
    - Bivarient:  Each sample point has two dimensions
    - Multivarient: Each sample point has multiple dimensions
- Graphical Representation of data
    - Dotplot is dated
        - Skipped
    - Stem and Leaf plot
        - Goal: To gauge the location, spread, and shape as well as any special properties of the data
        - Repeated stems can be used to represent data with alot of repetition
            - Lots of subjectivity, all that matters is that convention is followed
        - Steps:
            1. Sort the Data
            2. Identify stems
            3. Identify leaves
            4. Interpret
    - Symetric data is when if you draw a line in the middle of the graph and it is symetric on both sides, the data is symetric
    - Skewed data is where there is a clear displacement of data on one side of the graph
        - Skewed left is positively skewed
            - mean > median > mode
        - Skewed right is negatively skewed
            - mean < median < mode
    - Historgram
        - On the Y axis plot frequency or relative frequency
        - Bars always touch each other in a histogram otherwise it is a **bar graph**
        - Steps
            1. Frequency distribution
                - Identify the unique values or observations in the data set
            2. Write the frequency of each value
            3. Create class intervals
                - Class intervals span over numerous x axis units
                - Class intervals are equal in size
                - Class intervals are subjective to rules
                - Class intervals still add up to the same frequency amount
                - The wider the class intervals, the less detail will be shown in the frequencies
