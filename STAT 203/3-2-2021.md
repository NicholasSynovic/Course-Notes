## Hyper Geometric Distribution

- Hyper Geometric Experiment
  - Population is dichotonous and you are performing a random sample on that population
    - You are drawing data from a black box containing *n* trials
  - *m* number of Success
  - *n - m* failures
- Hyper Geometric Probability
  - p(x) = {(m! / x!(m - x)!) * ((n - m)! / (n - x)!)} / (N! / n!(N - n)!)
    - Where *m* is the number of successes, *x* is the value to be measured from the successes, *n* is the sample size, and *N* is the total population
    - x will not always equal 0 as a minimum
      - If *N - m* is less than *n*, the minimum value of x is *n - (N - M)*
    - x will not always be the maximum of the sample
      - maximum value for x is either *n* or *m*
- pmf of Hyper Geometric Probability
  - X ~ Hyp(n, m, N)
- Expected Value for Hyper Geometric Probability
  - E(x) = n ( m / N)

## Negative Binomial Distribution

- Number of successes is fixed
- Number of trials is random
- In other words: There is a known outcome, how many trials it takes to get to that point is random
  - Number of trials to get *r* successes
- Experiments consists of trials with 2 outcomes
- Number of success remains unchainged
- Trials are independent of one another
- *X* is the number of failures before *r*th success
- Negative Binomial Probability
  - p(x) = (x + r - 1)! / x!(r - 1)!
  - v(x) = (r (1 - p(x))) / p(x)^2
    - Varience larger than the mean which is uncommon
