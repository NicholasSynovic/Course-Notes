## Recap

### Joint Probability Distributions

- Involves multiple discrete random variables
  - The intersection between the two random variables
  - P(x, y) = P(X =x , Y = y)

## Marginal and Conditional Probability

- X, Y are independent if p(x, y) = p(x) * p(y) for all x, y
  - Check if the values for all of the marginals are equivalent
    - If they aren't the same for one value, then X and Y are not independent
- Use the included table to solve
  - P(X = x, Y = y) just go to the X and Y value and the answer is their intersection
  - P(X <= x, Y <= y) includes all values contained by y and x including the intersection
    - The inverse is all values outside of y and x including the intersection

### Marginal Probability Function

- Let p(x, y) be the join pmf for the discre random variables X, Y
  - Marginal pmf of X is p(x) = Sumation starting at y for p(x, y)
  - Marginal pmf of Y is p(y) = Sumation starting at x for p(x, y)
- Let f(x, y) be the joint pdf for the continous random variables X, Y
  - F(x) = intergrate of f(x, y) dy from y to some value
  - F(y) = intergrate of f(x, y) dx from x to some value
- The marginals of x is the sum of the entire row's values
- The marginals of y is the sum of the entire column's values

### Conditional Probability Functions

- it is the Joint PDF of (x, y) / marginal PDF of f(y) for p(x) with conditions x|y

## Expectations

- For CDF
  - It's a double integral
    - E(h(X, Y)) = integral of (integral of h(x, y)f(x, y) dx from x) dy from y
- For Discrete Functions
  - It's a double summation
    - Same form as integrals

### Properties of Expectations

- E(a) = a
- E(aX) = a * E(X)
- E(aX + b) = a * E(x) + b
- E(aX + bY) = a * E(x) + b * E(Y)
