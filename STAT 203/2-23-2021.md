## Review

- Inequalities
  - p(X <= 2) = p(x > 1)

## Specific Discrete Probability Distributions

- Binomial Distribution
  - Bernoli Special Case
- Hyper Geometric Distribution
  - Not used as much
- Negative Binomial Distribution
  - Geometric Special Case
- Poisson Distribution

## Binomial Distribution

- Two outcomes
  - Success or Failure
  - Outcomes are subjective to the experiment
- Binomial Experiement Requirements
  - There are *n* trials
  - Each trial has only 2 outcomes
    - Success or Failure
  - Probability of success in each trial remains unchanged from trial to trial
  - Trials are independent of one another
- Probability function of Binomial Distribution
  - p(x) = (n! / x!(n- x)!) * (p^x) * (1 - p)^(n - x)
    - Where *n* is the number of trials, *x* is the number of successes, and *p* is the probability of success
