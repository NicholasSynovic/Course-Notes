## Discrete Random Variables

- A random variable is a function that maps from S to R
  - S is the sample space of an experiment
  - R is the set of real numbers
  - Radom varaibles denoted by Capital Letters
    - Traditionally: X, Y, Z, and W
- Requires:
  - The possible values that X can take
    - Noted by x
  - What are the corresponding probabilities
    - P(X = x) or P(x)
- Probability Distribution of X
  - Denoted by P(X = x)
- Discrete Variables
- Continous Variables
  - Chapter Four Material
- Probability of Mass Function
  - P(x) >= 0 for all X
  - Summation of P(x) for all x = 1
    - Total probability always 1
- A parameter is an unknown constant that describes some characteristic of the population
- Cumulative Distribtion Function
  - F(x) = P(X <= x)
  - Probability up to x or to the of x

## Calculating Probabilities

- P(x = 3) P(3)
- P(x <= 3) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3)
- P(x > 2) = 1 - P(x <= 2)
- P(x < y) = 1 - P(x <= y - 1)
