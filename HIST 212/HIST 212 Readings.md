## Section 3
### The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How out Government Segregated America
- De Facto segregation examples are redlining and how whites are steered cleared of black neighborhoods and vice versa
  - Housing discrimination is part of the residue from slavery as determined by the thirteenth amendment and upheld in the Supreme Court
- De Jure segregation examples are law and public policy enforcing/encouraging segregation
  - The fifth amendment (government can't segregate) and the thirteenth amendment (ends slavery) are violated by both of these types of segregation
    - Thirteenth Amendment is applied to the Civil Rights Act, not just slavery
- Supreme Court can not change the results of years of segregation by forcing groups to live with one another. It can only up the law of the land
### Levittown Sections
- The Federal Housing Agency created a policy that was to explicitly encourage segregation
-  Levitttown was an undertaking to tackle the housing crisis after the war by building 17500 homes for veterans sold for 8K
  - Funded by the VA and the FHA
    - Little risk to the banks due to the FHA insuring the loans that people who were to buy homes were taking out
    - Due to the funding, the FHA was able to put in a condition that blacks could not buy homes in the neighborhood and loans would not be insured if there were blacks in a nearby neighborhood as well
      - Project 100% reliant on the government
      - New Jersey law made it so that Levittown was actually public assistance, thus homes could not not be sold to blacks
- Gary family harassed for moving into a FHA sanctioned town
  - NAACP and the Communist Party stepped in order to help the family when the police did not
    - It took the police a week to assist the family because they did not have the manpower to prevent violence
- Myer family attempted to move into Levittown in place of a White family who was moving out
  - Were harassed by mobs for months because of their decision to move
    - The state troops and local police were unable to assist in providing protection for them
- And argument for de jure segregation could be made on behalf of the Myer and Gary family due to the lack of police intervention and protection
### Congressional Committees and Unfriendly Witnesses
- McCarthy era communities that defined the era were congressional investigation committees
  - These committees often had duties that paralleled that of the president
    - Often acted as "hired guns" to target political opponents at key times
      - Pro-Conservative values
    - Committees had the power to fire individuals from jobs simply by sending them a subpoena to attend a congressional hearing
  - HUAC was one of these committees
    - Was created in 1938 under the New Deal, it was extremly effective at exposing those who were conducting un-American activities
      - Eventually was emulated at all levels of the national and local governments
      - HUAC developed a method of finding Communists that was practically scientific
        - Would get information from the public of FBI, bring in subjects individually, and interrogate them publicly until more names were given
          - The goal was exposure, not information
      - The Hollywood Ten were a group of screenwriters and directors who were members of the Communist Party who stood to HUAC and relied upon First Amendment protections
        - They did not receive their First Amendment protections and were sentenced to jail
- The First Amendment could not prevent people who were suspected of being Communist from going to jail, but the Fifth Amendment was a possibility
  - It was upheld by the Supreme Court because it was not a sensitive topic as the First Amendment
    - Issues with the fifth is that it could not be used to stop accusations from being thrown at individuals and that it did not stop notoriety of individuals
      - Scientists could be accused of spying for the Soviet Union and teachers were accused of brain washing their children
      - Being subpoenaed to appear before HUAC often resorted in the individual losing their job, regardless of whether or not the allegations were true
### We Must Keep the Labor Unions Clean

  - Soviets clearly broke multiple treaties, traditions, and rules set internationally as well as threats made by America to the Soviet Union
  - Soviets blatantly lied about their desire to make a base near America as purely defensive as their rockets were powerful enough to reach anywhere from the Soviet Union

### LBJ Champions the Civil Rights Act of 1964
- 5 days after JFK was killed, LBJ made a speech where he stood firm on the idea that civil rights should be written into law
- The riots in Birmingham and the murder of a civil rights leader lead JFK to push a tough civil rights bill through congress
  - Also started a very public lobbying campaign in order to encourage desegregation across the nation

  - You were more likely to die in Detroit than you were in WW2
  - Other crime rates were also sky rocketing
    - Could be because of better kept records or police tampering to receive more funding

    - Crime was the only profitable business there
  - Other central cities fell under hard fiscal times and had to rely on the states to bail them out
- Houston and other SunBelt cities did pretty well during the 70s
- More black politicians started to enter offices in city councils and city governments only to realize that there was little wealth left by their white predecessors
  - Some relied on the fact that they were black to win

### Planned Destruction The Interstates and Central City Housing
- Interstate project completed in fifteen years between 1956 - 1970
  - Required the destruction of many homes
- Highways tore through inner city homes and created new areas of development

- Highways were diverted through African American neighborhoods resulting in their destruction
  - It was assumed that the social consequences of the building of highways was to be the responsibility of other agencies

    - Second ghettos were created as the highways were created and the displaced civilians were forced to move
- Automobiles became the more popular form of transit as mass public transportation started to fade away
  - Congestion from traffic was unattractive and would result in less profit from real estate in cities and around cities as well
- Highways were to be constructed in order to penetrate into the business centers of inner cities

    - The highways would force people to be better was the argument at the time
    - No advanced housing was provided to those affected by the building of the highways
  - Would destroy housing that was ugly or dilapidated
- The building of I-40 through the Nashville ghetto revealed the affects that the highway system had on race relations
### Stokely Carmichael Black Power
- There was no national organization that was there to support African Americans when they were discriminated against
  - Only a Civil Rights movement to rally behind
    - Blacks wanted to reason but were beaten by the whites
- Civil Rights organizations need to speak for their local communities and not as the buffers for others outside of said communities
  - Must provide strength and a voice
- Any program to address racism must address that the group that is most affected by discrimination are the poor blacks
  - Must address that they are poor and they are black
- Change started with politics
  - It was an attempt to win black power in politics
    - It sometimes worked on the local level
      - Those that were elected are at risk of dying due to them being black and in power
      - Those that were elected are to be up for election again and their symbol on their ballot is the black panther
        - By electing blacks, you are giving the black community power to end discrimination
- Black power is meant to unify the blacks behind a common goal and to use this unionization to seize control
- The economy of the country must change in order to accommodate blacks
- The white community wants to integrate the black community
  - Does not fix the racial or economic disparity between the two
  - To have a better life, blacks must follow the white traditions
    - Removes the culture from blacks
- Whites are afraid of black power as it means violence and fear to them
  - Stokely argues that that is not the case and that black power is meant to empower the blacks and unite them under a single national icon or goal
- White culture has spread lies and contaminated the blacks into believing that they are less than the whites
  - Lies were told about them and culture depicts them as savages
- Blacks do not want to take over the country but they do want to create a community that empowers them and supports others
  - Essentially the American Dream
### MLK Civil Rights and Labor Rights
- Many of the original civil rights activists had fallen off the band wagon during the freedom summer of 64
  - Police and Klan murders kept moral low
  - Political supporters began to shy away from civil rights
- MLK attempted to tackle change head on by making strides to reduce the poverty line in Cleveland and Chicago
  - Didn't want to focus on local change, but national change
    - Was going to lead a march on DC in order to ask for more jobs for blacks
      - Issue was that historically organizing an army of the poor into DC often ends poorly
- Whites were disenfranchised with MLK as he spoke about economic racism and was opposed to Vietnam
  - The issue of Vietnam and the opinion he held was not a popular one
    - Turned the Civil Rights movement into an Anti-War movement as well
    - Was 2 years ahead of his time
- The Kerner Commission was a national organization put together by LBJ in reaction to the riots and violence
  - Determined that the nation was moving to two different groups
    - One white and one black, separate but unequal
- MLK's views on Vietnam correlated with LBJ not running for a second term due to his inability to pull out of Vietnam
- In Memphis, strikes were occurring because the sanitation and factory workers were unable to unionize and were being attacked by the police for protesting
  - MLK utilized this to boost his national plans of a strike on DC for jobs
    - He was uninformed on how bad it had gotten and only three blocks into a 6,000 people march did he have to abandon it due to rioting
      - His name was slandered
        - It was considered that he should not be at the head of rallies anymore due to that he was "unable to control a protest"
          - This was due to his team not gathering enough intelligence about how bad it was in Memphis
  - Attempted a second try on April 5th but this time more informed and considering about the youth of the protests who originally felt left out and forgotten from other protests
### The Women's Liberation Movement
- Women's Liberation Movement = Feminism
  - It was poorly documented and has lost some of its history
    - This is partly due to its grassroots nature and how broad and varied its success were
    - Partly due to the lack of respect modern media portrays feminists
- Many of the biases against feminists are still held against them today
  - Ironic because the feminists litterally could not be that way in order to accomplish change
- Femist movement began when women wanted to have more economic and political freedom
  - Movement arose due to women essentially being contained by their male peers into gendered defined roles
          - The Cold War essentially drove men and women into gender and sexual roles
            - Women did play a major role in factory employment during  the 50s however
- As women became more educated, they became more frustrated that they were being put into traditional gender roles
  - Some of these women became organizers and supporters of many influential groups throughout America
- Magazines glorified house wives but also encouraged women to go seek out their own independence
- Women would take part in activist campaigns and learn lessons from them to which they applied to their own secondary status
- The younger members of the left took up stronger and more radical positions in calling for social justice
  - Civil rights and hippies were in this new left movement
  - Student groups and other race based organizations were founded to promote these ideas as well
    - Slogan was to never trust anyone over the age of 30
      - Woman began to realize that they can join together to create their own group
- First wave feminism surrounded the issue of the vote
  - This was achieved in 1920 and the surviving members of the group still petitioned for feminist values and rights
  - National Organization for Women was created and brought in the Second wave of feminism which was focused on equal rights
    - NOW was focused on political lobbying
    - NOW created change that was focused on reducing sex based discrimination in the workplace and removing sex based hiring ads
  - Grass roots organizations sprung up around the country in order to provide women with a space to think and talk freely about the issues that prevail around them
    - These groups would offshoot into small more specific groups
    - Would lead to local change were as NOW created national change
    - Racism still an issue within these groups as blacks were not invited or not interested in a white woman's problems
    - There were often no leaders in these grassroots organizations
      - Would result in in-fighting and having unofficial leaders
- Feminists were able to accomplish political, educational, and cultural change
### Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm For the Equal Rights Amendment
- Law will not change human prejudice, but there should be no prejudice in law
- The benefits that will affect civilians will be greater than the benefits received by the nation

### Conservative Backlash on Feminism
- Conservatives fought feminism on the grounds of social conservatism
- Feminism would undermined the right to be a housewife
- Were against the pro-choice movement and the decision of Roe v Wade
- Often religious based reasoning against the feminist movement
### What's Wrong with Equal Rights for Women
- Immediately uses religion to justify not supporting the ERA
- The women's place is in the home
- Men work for women and thus women have it easy
- The actual work that needs to be done is made easier by men and thus the argument that women are struggling is null
- The ERA will make women subject to the draft
- The feminists do not relate to the average american woman who wants to only be a wife
### Enter Anita
- Liberal Miami was not comfortable with the gay population there
  - Originated from air force pilots returning there after there service
  - Police would harass and attack and publicly shame gay people
    - Shaming would involve defamation of their name
- Bob Basker was a proponent of gay rights
  - Disappointed that the Miami gay population did not step up for their own rights
    - Due to the abuse that they gay community was receiving, it made sense that the gays felt uncomfortable and did not want to step up
  -  Created a group to ensure that gay people got their rights
    - To get rights utilized the "gay vote" to entice politicians to support gay rights in return receiving the gays vote in elections
      - A gay rights bill was drafted that essentially made it clear that discrimination based off of the attraction of the same sex illegal in Miami
        - Sodemy was illegal in Miami and thus a provision had to be made that this bill did not apply to landlords
    - Those against them leveraged the Bible and conservative social norms
