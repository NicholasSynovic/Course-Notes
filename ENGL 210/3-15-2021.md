## [Collaborative Writing](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-collaborative-writing-1689761)

- Collaborative writing involves two or more people working together to produce a written document
  - It is an important subfield of composition studies

### Guidelines

  1. Know the individuals in your group. Establish rapport with your team.
  2. Do not regard one person on the team as more important than another.
  3. Set up a preliminary meeting to establish guidelines.
  4. Agree on the group's organization.
  5. Identify each member's responsibilities, but allow for individual talents and skills.
  6. Establish the time, places, and length of group meetings.
  7. Follow an agreed-on timetable, but leave room for flexibility.
  8. Provide clear and precise feedback to members.
  9. Be an active listener.
  10. Use a standard reference guide for matters of style, documentation, and format.

- As long as one person writes the text and others provide ideas or stream of consciensous thought, it is considered to be collaborative

### Benefits

1. Collaboration aids in problem finding as well as problem-solving.
2. Collaboration aids in learning abstractions.
3. Collaboration aids in transfer and assimilation; it fosters interdisciplinary thinking.
4. Collaboration leads not only to sharper, more critical thinking (students must explain, defend, adapt) but to a deeper understanding of others.
5. Collaboration leads to higher achievement in general.
6. Collaboration promotes excellence. In this regard, I am fond of quoting Hannah Arendt: 'For excellence, the presence of others is always required.'
7. Collaboration engages the whole student and encourages active learning; it combines reading, talking, writing, thinking; it provides practice in both synthetic and analytic skills."
