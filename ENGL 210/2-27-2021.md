## Pre-Interview

### [What job adverts REALLY mean](https://www.creativebloq.com/advertising/web-developer-job-ad-chart-11618853)

- Key Terms = Definition
  - Work on cutting edge technology = Do what everyone else is doing
  - A fast paced environment = Your job will be constant firefighting
  - Must be a team player = Must not question authority
  - Able to work with minimal supervision = You'll be the one we blame when something goes wrong
  - An Agile team = We have daily stand-ups
  - A market leader = Recently started making a profit
  - Rockstar developer = You will work very long hours with impossible deadlines
  - We have an urgent need = Our other rockstar just left and no one understands the code
  - Dynamic environment = Our leadership keeps changing priorities
  - Self-starter = We have no process
  - Passionate = Perservers through regular death marches

### [5 Ways Your Cover Letter Lost You the Job](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-your-cover-letter-lost-you-the-job)

- Cover letters give you some elbow room to disuss your qualifications
  - Can be easy to veer off in the wrong direction when piching yourself

#### WRONG: You didn't listen to the advice everyone gave you

- Keep your cover letter to a single page
- Pay attention to details
- Proofread

#### WRONG: You regurgitated your resume

- Don't reiterate your resume
  - Expand on it
- Use full sentences to explain your skill set versus bullet points

#### WRONG: You used a canned version

- Write a cover letter that's specific to the job and company you're applying to
- Explain why you are suited to that company's specific position
  - The more you specify, the more personal and vested your interest will seem

#### WRONG: You highlighted your weakness

- Focus on how your prior experiences make you qualified for this position

#### WRONG: You focused on what the company can do for you

- Write about how your enthusiasm will benefit the company
  - Make it seem mutually beneficial, but not that you are a leech

### [How to Write a Cover Letter: The All-Time Best Tips](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-write-a-cover-letter-31-tips-you-need-to-know)

- Cover letters do get read
  - Sometimes they are the most important parts of an application
  - Allow for the interpersonal and nuances of your experiences to shine through

#### Basics

- Write a fresh cover letter for each job
  - The more unique your cover letter seems, the more likely a call back will seem
    - You can recycle a few sentances
    - Use styling or language templates, but make them unique and have them stand out
      - Example templates [one](https://www.themuse.com/advice/cover-letters-are-hard-to-writebut-this-template-makes-it-a-breeze) and [two](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-perfect-cover-letter-template-to-show-off-your-skills)

#### Greeting and First Paragraph

- Include the hiring manager's name
  - Google the company's hiring manager or find it on the job application page
    - If that leads to a dead end, use the department chair or something like `[INSERT POSITION NAME] Hiring Manager`
- Never use `To whom it may concern` or `Dear Sir or Madam`
  - Archaic
  - Doesn't allow for customization of the cover letter
- Start off with a snappy first line that introduces who you are
  - [Examples](https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-cover-letter-examples)

#### What to Put in the Body of Your Cover Letter

- Go beyond your resume
  - Answer these questions:
    - What approach did you take to tackling one of the responsibilities you’ve mentioned on your resume?
    - What details would you include if you were telling someone a (very short!) story about how you accomplished that bullet point?
    - What about your personality, passion, or work ethic made you especially good at getting the job done?
- Write about how you can improve a company and not the other way around
- Highlight the right experiences
  - Drop the text of the job description into a [word cloud tool](https://www.wordclouds.com/) to find out what stands out
- Showcase your skills
- Nobody cares about your education
- Don't apologize for missing experience
  - Word your experiences to match what is being looked for if possible
- Throw in a few numbers
  - Use numbers (1, 50%, 1/4) not words (one, ten thousand, thirty three)
- Consider testimonials
- Be open to other formats of cover letters
  - Make it unique, but not crazy

#### How to Strike the Right Tone

- Cut the formality
  - Be professional, but not excessively formal
- Write in the company's voice or tone
- Go easy on the enthusiasm
- Don't let the fear of bragging get in the way

#### Your Final Words and Edits

- Keep it short and sweet
  - 250 words or less
  - Half a page is a good metric
- Finish strong
  - Example: `I’m passionate about [Company]’s mission and would love to bring my [add your awesome skills here] to this position.`

    - [Bad Examples](https://www.themuse.com/advice/3-cover-letter-closing-lines-that-make-hiring-managers-grimace-plus-better-options)
- Edits
  - Check for spelling and grammar mistakes
  - Set it aside for a few hours and then revist it
  - Use a tool like [Hemmingway](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-quick-way-to-tell-how-your-cover-letter-sounds-to-others) to analyze your sentences
- Have someone gut check it
