        - DNA in nucleus
        - DNA is most of the time chromatin
        - DNA during replication is chromosomes
        - Same number of chromosomes
        - 2 copies of each chromosomes in each cell
          - One from the parent
          - Diploid number is the total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell
          - Homologous is when members of the same pair in the diploid cell
      - Useful for any process that requires new cells
        - Healing, growth, etc.
      - Have 46 chromosomes in humans
      - Results in two daughter cells
    - Meiosis

  - Humans have 23 different chromosomes
  - Diploid = 2n = 46
    - 22 are homologous pairs
- Chromosomal abnormalities are due to the failure of homologus chromosome to separate properly during cell division
  - Occurs gametes will have inappropriate number of chromosomes

  - Trisomy is when you have an extra chromosome
  -
- DNA Structure 2: Chromosomes and Cell Division
  - DNA in two forms
    - Chromatin
      - Dispersed, uncoiled strands
    - Chromosomes are tightly wound discrete structures
    - Each has a distinct size and shape

### DNA Structure & Function

- Function 1: Replication
  - Each step is mediated by enzymes
  - First step in making new cells
    - Molecule divides into 2 separate strands
      - Each acts as a template for a new complimentary strands and proofreads/ error corrects
        - Can lead to uncontrollable mutations such as exponentially cell growth
          - If this occurs in sex cells it can be passed to the offspring

## Week 3

### Mendelian vs Complex Inheritance

- Qualitative variation
  - Phenotype variation charachterized as belonging to discrete, observable categories
- Quantitative variation
  - Phenotypic variation characterized by distribution of continuous various
- Polygenic traits
  - Expression depends on the action of multiple genes
    - Some genes contribute to obesity
      - Environment plays a role as well
- Complex Traits
  - Variation due to genetic factors and environments
- Pleiotropy
  - One gene with multiple pheonotypic effects
- Phenylketonuria (PKU)
  - Leads to the accumulation of large quantities of the amino acid phenylalanine which causes mental retardation and other phenotypic abnormalities
    - Example of Mendelian inheritance (this is a recessive condition), pleiotropy, environment
- Heritability
  - The proportion of total phenotypic variabilitiy observed for a given trait that can be ascribed to genetic factors
    - Equation:
      - Heritability = (Variability caused by genetics) / (variability caused by genetics + variability caused by environment)

### Mendelian Inheritance

- Genotype is a set of alleles an organism carries
- Phenotype is the observable feature of an organism that is under genetic control
- Strucutral genes contain information to make a protien
  - Similar in related species
- Regulatory genes guide expression of structural genes
  - Critical in determining species form
- Gregor Mendel discovered laws of inheritance (mid 1800s)
  - Did so using pea plants
  - Found that inheritance was particulate or separate
- Linkage is when genes found on the same chromosome are said to be linked
  - The closer they are, the greater the linkage
- Crossing over makes possible the independent assortment of linked genes
- X Linked Traits are mutations that occur on the x chromosome
  - More common in males
