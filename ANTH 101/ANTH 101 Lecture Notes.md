## Week 3

### Lecture 3

- Gegor Mendel (1822-1884)
  - Discovered laws of inheritance in the mid 1800s
    - Law of Segregation
    - Law of Independent Assortment
- Geneotype
  - Two alleles
- Phenotype
  - Observable characteristic
- Allele
  - Different version of a same gene
- Dominant
- Recessive
- Co-Dominant
  - Two different alleles of a gene are expressed in a heterozygous individiual
    - Most common in the ABO blood group in humans
- Homozygous
  - When there are the same alleles in the geneotype
- Heterozygous
  - When there are the different alleles in the geneotype
- Punnet Squares are the best way to determine the geneotype of offspring
  - Must use XX and XY when determining traits on sex cells
    - Put an astric by each X chromosome that has a condition
- Linkage is when genes are close to each other on the same chromosome they share traits
  - Ear wax color and consistency are linked yet they are different traits
- Sex Linked Traits
  - Genetic conditions that result from mutations to genes on the X or Y chromosome
  - More common on the X chromosome as it is larger
    - More common in men as they only have ONE X chromosome
  - Also known as X Linked Traits
- Polygenic is when many genes affect one trait
- Pleiotropic is when one gene has many traits
