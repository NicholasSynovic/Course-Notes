### Pages 15 - 29
* 1856 Neanderthal Man was discovered in Germany.
* 1859 Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species
	* Darwin made more of an impact than Neanderthal Man
* Anthropology started around the nineteenth century
	* Second generation of researchers popularized the subject
		* Popularized by Sherwood Washburn
		* Started to analyze primates and their behaviors instead of just dissecting them
* Creationism/ Intelligent Design is a religious belief, while evolution is a scientific theory
* Science is a process that is ongoing; it does not create one answer immediately
* Aristotle and Plato believed that all life was hierarchical with humans being on top
	* Fit moral and legal standings at the time
	* Renaissance challenged these ideas due to the recognition that humans have different cultures
* Charles Darwin's trip to the Galapagos Islands
	* Went there, saw a bunch of birds, took them home, a few years later he realized that evolution had changed each one of the birds due to the shape of their beaks
	* Observations in the On the Origin of Species
		* All organisms have the potential for explosive population growth that would outstrip their food supply
		* In the real world, we see populations that are roughly stable
	* Deductions from the observations
		* There must be a struggle for existence
			* Natural selection
		* Nature is full of variation and some variations must be favored more so than others
* Natural selection must work if three preconditions are met
	* The trait must be inherited
	* The trait must show variation between individuals
	* The filter between the organism and its genetic makeup is the environment which must exert some pressure in order for natural selection to act
* Creationism is the belief that a single creative force created the universe
	* The big bang or God
	* Religious creationism believes that the scientific understanding of how the Universe came to be is no more theoretical than that of the Bible

## Week 2

## Chapter 3
* DNA can be rcove3rd from a wide range of biological substances

## Week 3

### Chapter 4
* Geneticists estimate that DNA base sequences in humans and chiomps are at lest 95% identical
	* The remaining 5% is accounted for by a variety of insertions, deletions, variable gene copy numbers, and inversions of DNA sequences
* Geneotype is ACTG
* Phenotype is a physical feature
*  Alleles can be recessive, dominant, or codominat
	* Recessive alleles need to be present in both strands to be displayed
	* Dominant alleles need to be present in only one strand to be displayed
	* Codominant alleles are when two dominant alleles are expressed at once 
* Gregor Mendel pioneered genetics by experimenting on pea plants
	* Measured phenotypes between hybrids of plants
	* Hereditary characteristics are controlled by particulate genes that exist in pairs in individual organisms.
	* When an individual has two different genes responsible for a characteristic, only one is expressed and is said to be dominant to the other, which is said to be recessive.
		* Should be expanded to include codominate genes
	* During the formation of gametes, the paired unit factors separate, or segregate, randomly so that each sex cell receives one or the other with equal likelihood.
		* Mendel's Law of Segregation
		* Punnett Square
	* During gamete formation, segregating pairs of unit factors assort independently of each other.
		* Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment
			* Only applies to genes on different chromosomes
				* Genes that are on the same chromosome should segregate together and find themselves in the same sex cells
					* Known as linkage
* Mutations are errors that occur in the replication of DNA that becomes established in a daughter cell
	* A point mutation occurs when a single base in a gene is changed
	* Insertion and Deletion Mutations is when there is a respected extra or removal of a gene pair on a chromosome
	* Mutations are not always bad; some are detrimental, neutral, or beneficial to the health of the individual or the population
* X-Linked Disorders are diseases and mutations caused by the X chromosome
	* More common in men as they only have one X chromosome
* Mendelian Genetics is most useful when evaluating qualitative traits
	* Qualitative traits are traits that we see that affect individuals
	* Quantitative traits are traits that affect a population
* Polygenetic traits rely on more than one allele being present for the trait to be shown
* Pleiotropy is one gene can have multiple affects on the phenotype of an individual

## Week 4

### P. 68 - 72
* Mutations
	* Mutations occur when an error arises in a daughter cell
		* If it happens in a sex cell it can be carried over to the child
* Point Mutation and Sickle Cell Disease
	* Point mutation occurs when a single base in a gene is changed
		* Sickle Cell disease is a disease that is caused by this genetic error
			* Only happens when the parents are homozygous for the recessive disease
			* Known as an autosomal recessive disease
* Insertion and Deletion Mutations
	* Insertion mutation
		* When a gene is added
		* Trinucleotide repeat disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that is caused by a dominant allele
			* It is an autosomal dominant disease
	* Deletion mutation
		* When a gene is deleted
* Mutations: Bad, Neutral, and Good
	* Mutations that occur in non coding errors are neutral because they do not affect the phenotype
	* Mutations are the absolute source for variation in a population
* X Linked Disorders
	* Disorders that occur on the X chromosome
	* Men are more susceptible to these diseases as they only have on X chromosome

### P. 83 - 91
* Where Does Variation Come From?
	* Mutations
* How Natural Selection Works
	* Not about genes
	* Acts on the organisms phenotype
	* Directional selection is natural selection that drives evolutionary change by selecting for greater or lesser frequency of a given trait in a population
	* Stabilizing selection is when a certain pheonotype is selected against deviations from it
* Other Ways by Which Evolution Happens
	* Gene flow
		* When animals migrate from one place to another
			* Migration relates to populations moving
			* Gene flow refers to the genetic material they carry with them
				* Can produce evolutionary change
				* Very little is needed to eleminate the harmful effects of inbreeding
	* Genetic Drift
		* A change in frequency caused by random events
		* A genetic bottleneck is when a large population suddenly dies off and lots of the mutations acquired disappear with that population
	* Darwin and Sexual Selection
		* Nonrandom mating
		* Sexual dimorphism is brought about between two different sexes of the same species under go nonrandom mating
		* When one sex is more desirable than the other, the other sex will fight for mating control in order to get more reproductive potential
		* Reproductive variance is a measure of variation from the mean of a population in the reproductive potential of one sex compared with the other

### P. 91 - 98
* Taxonomy and Speciation
	* Linnaeus classified species based off of physical appearance
* Taxonomy today is called systematics
	* Rely on homology which is the similarity of traits fresulting from shared ancestry
		* Some traits are analogous which means that they were created for a purpose, not because of a common ancestor
			* Usually due to convergent or parallel evolution which is where a trait is developed due to circumstance under natural selection and not shared ancestry
	* Create cladograms which are branching diagrams showing evolved relationships among members of a lineage
* What Is a Species?
	* A species is an interbreeding group of animals or plants that are reproductivly isolated through anatomy, ecology, behavior, or geographic distribution from all other such groups
	* Speciation is the formation of one or more new species via reproductive isolation
* Species Concepts
	* Biological species concept was first proposed by Ernst Mayr and defines species as interbreeding populations reproductively isolated from one another
* Reproductive isolating mechanisms are any factor that prevents a male and female of two different species from hybridizing
* How Species are Formed
	* Anagenesis is evolution of a trait or a species into another over a period of time
	* Cladogenesis is evolution through the branching of a species or a lineage
	* Allopatric speciation is speciation occurring via geographic isolation
	* Parapatric Speciation is speciation occurring when two populations have continuous distributions and some phenotypes in that distribution are more favorable than others
* Tempo Of Speciation
	* Gradualism is the Darwinian view of a slow incremental evolutionary change
	* Macroevolution is large scale evolutionary change over a long time period or evolution of major pheotypic changes over a relatively short time period
	* Punctuated equilibrium is the model of evolution characterized by rapid bursts of change followed by long periods of stasis

## Week 7

### Pages 89 - 91
* Darwin and Sexual Selection
	* Nonrandom mating brought about by sexual selection is another major evolutionary force
		* Struggle between males to gain access to mates
			* Sex with the more limited reproductive potential should be competed over by the sex with the greater reproductive potential
				* Since there are less females than males, males tend to fight for mates
				* Since females only have a certain time that they can produce offspring, competition is high
		* Struggle by females to choose the right mate
			* Under selection pressure to choose a male that offers her a direct benefit
			* Female choice of partner leads to offspring inheriting those traits
				* Increased male body size is an outcome of nonrandom sexual selection

				* Semi-free-ranging environments are large open areas (often small islands) where nonhuman primates are kept in captivity to be studied
* The Evolution of Primate Social Behavior
	* The immediate behaviors we see are caused by a proximate which involve hormonal, physiological reasons

## Week 8

### Pages 200 - 218
* Paleontology is the study of extinct organisms based on their fossilized remains
	* Study of what the fossil is, how it lived and the age of the fossil, how it came to be preserved
* Fossils are the preserved remnants of once living things often buried in the ground
	* Fossils are the result of petrification or the process of being turned into stone
		* It is possible for soft tissue or whole animals to be found petrified
	* Trace fossils are footprints trails
	* Coprolites are fossilized feces
* Geology is the study of the earth
* Thaphonomy is the study of what happens to remains from death to discovery
n	* To become a fossil the organism must be preserved by burial
		* Burial is a natural process in which the carcass or part of it is covered with sediment
			* It interrupts the biological process of decay
* Stratigraphy allows us to determine which rock faces/ fossils are older than others simply by looking at how they were formed or preserved
* The Geographic Time Scale is a way of measuring how old the Earth is
	* Relative Dating Techniques allow us to use principle of stratigraphy to date a fossil to a specific period of time in the Geographic Time Scale
		* Lithostratigraphy uses characteristics of the rock layers themseleves to correlate across regions
			* Tephrostratigraphy is a form of lithostatigraphy in which the chemical fingerprint of a volcanic ashi is used to correlate across regions
		* Biostratigraphy uses the principle of faunal succession to correlate age between sites and across regions based on the index fossils found at those sites
	* Calibrated Relative Dating Techniques make use of geological or chemical processes that can be calibrated to a chronological scale if certain conditions are known
		* Geomagnetic polarity records the orientation of sediments from different intervals
	* Chronometric Dating Techniques provide a chronological age estimate of the antiquity of an object in years before the present
		* Radiometic Dating relies on the natural clock like decay of unstable isotopes of an element to more stable forms
		* Fission Track Dating provides age estimates for noncrystalline materials that contain uranium
		* Comsmogenic Radionuclide Techniques are relatively new methods that provide radiometric age estimates of the length of time sediments have been buried
		* Uranium Series Techniques use the decay of certain elements to determine ages
		* Radiocarbon dating is the primate technique for estimating the atniquity of organic tiems from the latest Pleistocene through the present including primate and human fossils as well as artifacts from archaeological sites and sometimes forensic contexts.

## Week 9

### Pages 242 - 268
* Walking upright is an extremely rare way to move about
	* There is the issue of balancing the bodys weight over just two limbs while standing and often over one limb while walking
	* The spine/ vertebral column is a series of bones in the neck, thorax, lower back, and pelvic regions of the body
		* Bipeds have an s-shaped column
			* The amount of weight being supported increases as one moves down the spine
				* Lower back problems are the result of having an increases amount of weight on the spine
			* The skull balances on top of it
	* The pelvis of hominins was also modified by natural selection to keep the body;s center of gravity over one foot while walking
		* Pelvis consists of two innominate bones each composed of three other bones that fuse during adolescence and the sacrum which is a part of the vertebral column
	* The pelvis places the top of the femur far to the side of the biped
		* Natural selection favored bipeds with a femur that was angled from the the hip into the knee because the angle places the foot below the center of gravity which saves energy while walking
			* Thins angle means that the muscles attached to the femur also act at an anagle and when they contracti n an effort to extend the knee the muscles pull both up and out
		* The foot skeleton is composed of three types of bones
			* Tarsals which form the heel and ankle region
			* Metatarsals
			* Phalanges
	* The advantage of having two legs is that it frees up the arms to do other things
* Natural selection drove the evolution of bipedalism because in each subsequent generation once the shift began each transitional stage conferred survival and reproductive benefits on individuals
* The majority of the fossil evidence of the earliest hominins has come from the Greate Rigty Valley of East Africa
	* 10 - 5.5 million years ago and 5.5 - 4 million years ago a lineage of apes became bipedal
* Selective Pressure and the Origin of Hominins
	* Energetic efficiency
		* Being bipedal is more efficient than a quadraped
			*  Also allows for better heat disapation
	* Ecological and Dietary Influences on Bipedalism
		* Being able to stand up and see ones surroundings was a benefit against those that could not
	* Sexual Selection, Mating Strategies and Bipedalism

		* Utilization of bones, teeth, and horns
*  Due to the fossil record, it is difficult to determine the lineage tree from one species into the next
	* Often split it up into East and South African Australopithecus Species
* The Nariokotome boy is one of the major fossils of the Homo erectus species
*  The oldest discoveries of the Homo species come from the Pleistocene
